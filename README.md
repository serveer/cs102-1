Course Selection Project
My first Java project, an admin with username "Admin" and password "Admin001" gets to login and create courses and students to registere in the course.

All created courses and students are stored when Admin EXITs. After Admin exists, a student can login with the admin defined username and password,
please remember to use exit for both Admin and student and not restart the program directly, the program will only store information when exiting.

Any user action takes in a number input for further action. User do not input "1.Admin" or "Admin" to choose Admin, a simple "1" will suffice.
